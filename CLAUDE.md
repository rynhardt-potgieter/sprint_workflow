# Sprint Workflow — Development Conventions

These rules govern how Claude Code orchestrates development work across any project using this plugin system.

## Plugin

| Plugin | Version | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `sprint-workflow` | 3.2.1 | 9 specialist agents, 22 engineering skills (incl. `worktree-handoff`), 12 commands, sentinel-gated Stop hook, auto skill discovery, Linear MCP (opt-in), Codex delegation (opt-in), recovery commands (continue/resume-task/handoff), bug-triage, grill, retro, rollback |

Install via: `/plugins marketplace add rynhardt-potgieter/sprint_workflow` then `/plugins install sprint-workflow`

All engineering-standards skills are bundled inside the plugin. Agents access them via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.

### Optional Integrations

| Integration | Detection | Purpose |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| **Linear MCP** | Auto-detected via `mcp__linear__*` or `mcp__claude_ai_Linear__*` tools | Single-track sprint management in Linear (replaces markdown plan files) |
| **Codex CLI** | Auto-detected via `/codex:rescue` + `/codex:adversarial-review` skills | Token-efficient task execution and cross-model QA |

Both are opt-in. When unavailable, the plugin operates identically to v2.x (markdown tracking, Claude-only agents).

## Command Surface (12 total)

### Core lifecycle
- `/sprint-plan` — produce a sprint plan (accepts `--grill` for spec interrogation first)
- `/sprint-enrich` — specialist enrichment of the plan
- `/sprint-start` — execute the 6-phase flow
- `/sprint-review` — quality gates on completed work outside sprint flow
- `/sprint-status` — current sprint status from Linear or MD

### Recovery & resumption
- `/sprint-continue` — resume an interrupted sprint, idempotent
- `/sprint-resume-task <id>` — re-run a single task without re-entering the full flow
- `/sprint-handoff` — write `docs/SPRINT_HANDOFF.md` snapshot for the next session

### Quality & reflection
- `/sprint-bug-triage` — multi-agent bug review → user triage → Linear sub-issues OR `docs/BUG_BACKLOG.md`
- `/sprint-grill` — pre-plan interrogation against the domain model
- `/sprint-retro` — data-driven retrospective at sprint end
- `/sprint-rollback` — safety-gated sprint revert

## The Sprint Lifecycle

### `/sprint-plan` — Plan

The orchestrator feeds user context to the `product-manager` agent, which produces a structured sprint plan:

1. **Read the spec** — PRD, design doc, roadmap, or issue list
2. **Analyze the codebase** — understand what's built vs what's planned
3. **Write user stories** (INVEST criteria) with MoSCoW prioritization
4. **Define acceptance criteria** — testable, specific, Given/When/Then where complex
5. **Assign agents and skills** to each story
6. **Group stories** — parallel groups (no dependencies) vs sequential groups
7. **Flag codex-eligible tasks** — when Codex is available, each task gets a delegation flag
8. **Output** — Linear issues (if Linear MCP available) OR `docs/SPRINT_PLAN.md` (default)

The plan returns to the main session for user review before proceeding.

### `/sprint-enrich` — Enrich (Optional)

Specialist agents review the plan and add domain expertise:

- `dba-agent` — migration safety, index recommendations, PII flags
- `security-agent` — OWASP concerns, auth gaps, dependency vetting
- `test-writer` — test cases per story (unit, integration, mocks)
- `qa-playwright` — E2E scenarios, accessibility checks, visual baselines
- `backend-dev` / `frontend-dev` — technical risks, anti-patterns, complexity flags

Enrichments are consolidated and merged into the plan before execution. When Codex is available, enrichment also confirms/overrides codex-eligible flags based on complexity findings.

### `/sprint-start` — Execute

The orchestrator dispatches agents in a strict 6-phase flow:

**The sprint lead NEVER writes code.** It only dispatches, tracks, and updates the plan.

| Agent | Role | Model | Skills (Always) | Skills (Conditional) |
|-------|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| `backend-dev` | Server-side code | opus | `code-standards` | `dotnet-api`, `rust-cli`, `api-design`, `postgresql-data`, `security-compliance`, `cqrs-patterns`, `event-mqtt`, `bpmn-workflow`, `cli-agent-patterns`, `rust-testing` |
| `frontend-dev` | Client-side UI | opus | `code-standards` | `react-typescript`, `api-design`, `event-mqtt`, `security-compliance`, `computational-geometry` |
| `test-writer` | Tests | sonnet | `code-standards` | `dotnet-api`, `react-typescript`, `rust-testing`, `api-design` |
| `qa-agent` | Quality gates | sonnet | `code-standards` | All skills relevant to work being validated |
| `qa-playwright` | E2E browser testing | sonnet | `code-standards`, `react-typescript` | `api-design`, `security-compliance` |
| `docs-agent` | Documentation | sonnet | `code-standards`, `api-design` | All domain-relevant skills |
| `dba-agent` | Database & compliance | opus | `postgresql-data`, `security-compliance`, `code-standards` | `dotnet-api` |
| `security-agent` | Security audits | opus | `security-compliance`, `code-standards`, `api-design` | All domain-relevant skills |
| `product-manager` | Sprint planning & specs | opus | All available skills | — |

**Every agent follows a 3-step onboarding:**
1. Read skill files (project-local priority, then plugin-bundled standards)
2. Read project CLAUDE.md
3. Execute the task

#### Phase 1: Implementation Agents
Dispatch agents per the plan's parallel groups. Tasks flagged `codex-eligible` route to `/codex:rescue` (main session invokes directly). Non-eligible tasks dispatch Claude opus agents as before. Launch independent tasks in parallel. **Update tracking** (Linear or MD) after each agent completes.

#### Phase 2: Test Writer
Dispatch `test-writer` (and `qa-playwright` for E2E) after implementation completes. Include acceptance criteria and test cases from the enrichment. **Update the plan** after tests are written.

#### Phase 3: Quality Gates (parallel)
Dispatch BOTH simultaneously:
- **QA (Codex-first)**: When Codex available, main session runs build/lint/test + `/codex:adversarial-review` with skill-driven focus strings. When unavailable, dispatches `qa-agent` (Claude sonnet) as fallback.
- `pr-review-toolkit:code-reviewer` — code quality, patterns, UX regressions (always Claude)

#### Phase 4: Fix Loop
For each BLOCKING issue from Phase 3, classify the fix:
- **Surgical** (single file, lint, null check, test) → `/codex:rescue` (when available)
- **Architectural** (multi-file, design, interface) → re-dispatch original Claude agent
Re-validate after each fix. Loop until PASS — no task completes with known violations.

**Update tracking** (Linear or MD) with issues found and resolved.

#### Phase 5: Documentation
Dispatch `docs-agent` for: technical docs, CHANGELOG, README updates, version bumps, ADRs.

#### Phase 6: Commit & Push
The orchestrator (main session) commits directly using `git-flow` or `tfs-flow` skill (auto-detected):
1. **Logical commit/checkin separation** — one per feature, tests separate, docs separate
2. **Message format**: `<type>(<scope>): <summary>` (same for both Git and TFVC)
3. **Finalize tracking** — Linear: set all tasks/stories to "Done". MD: mark all stories `completed` in plan document.
4. **Push** — only after all gates pass

## Spec-Driven Development

Every implementation task MUST be tied to a source specification. Agents do not decide what to build — the spec does.

### Agent Self-Validation

Before marking a task complete, agents MUST:
1. Re-read the spec section quoted in their prompt
2. Verify every element exists in their implementation
3. Confirm user-facing strings match the spec exactly
4. Fix any deviation before reporting done

### Sprint-Lead Coordination

The sprint lead MUST:
1. Read the project's spec documents
2. Extract verbatim spec sections for each task
3. Write explicit acceptance criteria (verifiable by reading code)
4. Include anti-patterns from spec "What We Avoid" sections
5. Include the user test scenario
6. Reference spec file paths so agents can find full context
7. Verify agent output against spec after completion

## Breaking Change Safety

When removing, renaming, or changing the signature of any exported function, type, component, API endpoint, or interface:

1. **Before touching the declaration**, grep for the old name across the ENTIRE codebase
2. **Update every consumer** in the same change
3. **Applies to**: TS/JS exports, C# public methods, API routes, store actions, hooks, types, CSS classes
4. **Why**: Type checkers may pass if the broken file isn't in the active compilation path, but the app crashes at runtime

---

## Post-Task Workflow

After completing every implementation task:

1. **Build check** — run the project's build/type-check commands
2. **Consumer search** — if exports were renamed/removed, grep for old names across full codebase
3. **Code Review** — spin up `pr-review-toolkit:code-reviewer`
4. **Documentation** — spin up `docs-agent` (background) to update docs if needed

---

## Execution Order Summary

```
/sprint-plan    → detect Linear/Codex → product-manager creates plan
                  (flags codex-eligible tasks) → user reviews
                                                      ↓
/sprint-enrich  → specialist agents review plan (optional)
                  confirm/override codex-eligible flags → user approves
                                                      ↓
/sprint-start   → load plan from Linear OR markdown
                  Phase 1: implementation (codex-eligible → Codex, else → Claude agents)
                      ↓ update tracking (Linear or MD)
                  Phase 2: test-writer + qa-playwright
                      ↓ update tracking
                  Phase 3: QA (Codex adversarial review) + pr-review-toolkit (Claude)
                      ↓ BLOCKING issues?
                  Phase 4: fix loop (surgical → Codex, architectural → Claude)
                      ↓ re-validate → loop until clean
                  Phase 5: docs-agent (docs, changelog, version)
                      ↓ update tracking
                  Phase 6: commit/checkin → finalize tracking (Linear → Done, MD → completed)

| `PostToolUse` | Edit/Write | Language-specific type-check reminder |
| `PreToolUse` | Bash (git push) | Build verification gate |

---

## Linear MCP Integration (v3.0)

When Linear MCP is detected, sprint tracking uses Linear as the **sole source of truth** (no markdown plan files):

| Concept | Linear Mapping | Label |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| Sprint | Milestone | — |
| Story | Issue (top-level) | Epic (#4cb782) |
| Task | Sub-issue (parentId → Story) | Task (#f2994a) |

- **Single-track**: Either Linear OR markdown, never both
- **Auto-detected**: presence of `mcp__linear__*` or `mcp__claude_ai_Linear__*` tools
- **Mid-sprint fallback**: if Linear goes down, prompt user to approve MD fallback
- **Status lifecycle**: Backlog → Todo → In Progress → In Review → Done / Canceled

## Codex Delegation (v3.0)

When Codex CLI is detected, eligible tasks route to Codex for token conservation:

- **QA is Codex-first**: Main session runs build/lint/test + `/codex:adversarial-review` instead of dispatching Claude qa-agent
- **PR review stays Claude**: `pr-review-toolkit:code-reviewer` is always Claude
- **Task delegation**: Sprint-plan flags tasks as `codex-eligible`. Phase 1 routes eligible tasks to `/codex:rescue`
- **Fix routing**: Surgical fixes (single file, lint, null check) → Codex. Architectural fixes → original Claude agent
- **Model**: Always best available Codex model unless user overrides
- **Auto-detected**: presence of `/codex:rescue` + `/codex:adversarial-review` skills

## Key Principles

- **Sprint lead never writes code** — only orchestrates agents
- **Vertical slices** — one feature end-to-end before the next
- **Never skip QA** — manual build checks are not a substitute
- **Spec is truth** — agents implement what the spec says, not what they think is better
- **Retry until clean** — no task is complete with known violations
- **Minimal fixes** — prefer targeted fixes over structural redesigns
- **Single-track tracking** — Linear OR markdown, never both simultaneously
- **Codex for execution, Claude for review** — conserve tokens by routing scoped work to Codex
- **Always set `name:` in docker-compose.yml** — prevents container collisions
- **Update CLAUDE.md** — when establishing new patterns or fixing recurring mistakes
